- 👋 Hi, I’m @lydiabasinger1
- 👀 I’m interested in creating immersive VR trainings with a special focus in the field of medicine.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program VR through XRTerra. My hope is that by the end of this bootcamp I'll be able to create immersive courses for nursing staff at retirement communities and assisted living. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on medical trainings that increase the learners empathy, understanding, and capability
